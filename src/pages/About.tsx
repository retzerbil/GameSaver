				This is a simple example of a React application with a few pages and
				components. The app uses the
				<a href="https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/">CheapShark API</a> to fetch
				games and display them in a list. The user can search for games, sort
				the results, and find the cheapest price for their favorite games. The
				app is built with React, TypeScript, Mantine UI library and Tabler icons.
